# Calculator

Calculator that computes basic math.

This was the first project that I made utilizing objects. Was very helpful in solidifying my knowledge of how objects store data. While also added and retriving data from an object.

Also was a good project to learn how to condense code. I originally made individual event listeners for each numbered button. After it got to a functional state I found out how to make a function that looped over each numbered button and would add the event listeners to each button. This was able to cut down on over 100 lines of code, while also making it easier to navigate the code base.
